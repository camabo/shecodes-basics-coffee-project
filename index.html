      Though coffee is now a global commodity, it has a long history tied
      closely to food traditions around the Red Sea. The earliest credible
      evidence of coffee drinking in the form of the modern beverage appears
      in modern-day Yemen from the mid-15th century in Sufi shrines, where
      coffee seeds were first roasted and brewed in a manner similar to
      current methods.
